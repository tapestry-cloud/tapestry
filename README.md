# Tapestry
Simple static sites with the league of extraordinary packages [plates](http://platesphp.com/) template system.

## Installing
Tapestry may be installed via composer globally so long as `~/.composer/vendor/bin` is in your `$PATH`. To do so:
    `$ composer global require carbontwelve/tapestry`

## Not invented here
[StaticGen](https://www.staticgen.com/) has a list of other static site generators available, although to my knowledge Tapestry is the only one to use the PHPPlates template engine.
